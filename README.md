# Platformer Demo
This simple platforming demo was made in the **Monogame framework** and **reads its level from JSON**. 

The **movement and collision** is inspired by the movement in Celeste and Towerfall ascension as described on [Maddie Thorson's website](https://maddymakesgames.com/articles/celeste_and_towerfall_physics/index.html), categorizing all objects as solids or actors; Actors such as players or enemies can _never_ overlap solids.
